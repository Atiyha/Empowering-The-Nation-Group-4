        <p>Empowering the Nation was established in 2018 and offers courses in Johannesburg.</br>
            Hundreds of domestic workers and gardeners have been trained on both the six-month long</br>
            Learnerships and six-week Short Skills Training Programmes to empower themselves and
            can provide more marketable skills</p>

            <h2>About us</h2>
            <p> The SME is an initiative by Precious Radebe to provide skills training for domestic workers 
                and gardeners.</br> Her parents and other elderly relatives were never given the chance to upskill 
                themselves or follow a formal educational qualification,</br> so this training school is her way of 
                supporting similarly affected members from her community. </br>The training she provides upskills
                domestic workers and gardeners by making them more marketable when seeking employment </br>
                and enables them to be paid at a higher rate because of these additional skills.</br> They can also 
                be entrepreneurs and setup their own small business utilising these newly obtained skills.</br>
                Many employers would like to have their employees upskilled to offer more skilled services to 
                the household </p>
