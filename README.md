SELF EVALUATION ESSAYS

Liam Marais

During WIL I learned how to use a brainstorming session, Time management and crisis management. In the beginning of the project our team had brainstorming sessions to try and make ideas for what the app and website would look like and how the user experience would be. We also had brainstorming sessions after we knew what were going to do to try and improve on what we already had. I also used time management to meet the deadlines that the team had set for us to be finished in time. I had to use crisis management to try and fix issues that we had with the website as well as try to fix code that may have had errors. 
My role in the team was to be the head coder for the website although Dezlan and Atiyha helped a lot with the codding, content and visuals of the website. While making the website Dezlan and Atiyha always brought up good points about the website, I also did the same for the app and the presentations. 
To find more information about how we were going to make the website I decided to look at some of the other colleges websites to get an idea of what the website would look like. I used the internet to brows through some of the websites that colleges have and made a skeleton of what was in some of the websites.
I believe I exceled in my time management as I always met the deadlines that we set for ourselves I think that was my main strong point. My main weak point was presenting I donâ€™t like giving presentations especially to groups of people. 
I enjoyed the way that the WIL instructor presented his lessons, he made everyone feel welcome and heard in his classes.
I helped the group be staying positive and by staying up to date with the deadlines the we made 
WIL was a great way to show how working in a group for the certain task could be in the real world work environment.

Within the module Work Integrated Learning, I learnt that the purpose of it is to a educate learners in 21st century skills. 21st Century Skills consist of Academic Skills being problem solving and critical thinking, Interpersonal Skills being communication and collaboration skills and Interpersonal Skills being self-management skills. We are being taught how to professionally manage ourselves in the future by using the skills we learn in this module. 

Within this module I learnt how to manage my time, manage crises and effectively plan and brainstorm within a team to understand the tasks at hand. Throughout the semester I also learnt how to present myself in front of an audience. When it comes to managing time, I constantly set up times for the team to talk and plan the presentation, regularly spacing out the meetings to ensure that we all understand where we are and are all keeping up with the pace. I also learnt how to effectively maneuver and assist the team when it came to facing problems and how to get around each challenge. I also had to manage the problems that came with coding my application, as at first I had trouble choosing a software because most people went with Typescript whereas I went with Kotlin. I also had trouble fixing my code for it to run correctly as each time I ran it, it came up with an error and refused to run smoothly. 

My role on the team was to develop and create the mobile Application as well as coming up with the PowerPoint presentations. Liam and Dezlan assisted a lot in the planning and designing and determining how the app would look and run. As well as contributing and planning the content that would be put out one the app and website. 

To gather information on how we wanted the application to look I looked at other simple college apps to get a vague idea of who we wanted the app to look and edited it to our liking as well as to suit our skill set. I then created the structure of how we wanted the app, so it was just a skeleton. 

I believe I managed the time spacing for planning really well, as well as ensuring each member knew what they had to do when it came to developing the work that we needed to. I also believe I strived in making interesting and creative PowerPoints to easily display and present the work that we needed to. While I felt like I did okay when developing the application, I did face challenges when running it, as I was unsure as to why my error refused to run, although I shortly after learnt that my emulator crashing was not in my control. Although I do feel like we could have done more to make both the website and application look more appealing and less formally professional. I also believe that I managed to reach deadlines although I did run into issues that I could not control and had to stay away from one of the presentations that we had to do when displaying the semi-final application and website. 

Within our WIL lectures, the coordinator/lecturer made us feel welcome and was easy to talk to. He was patient when it came to trying to understand our issues and understanding when it came to our struggles. I feel like we could have made the relationship a lot stronger had we been more interactive with him. Although despite being a good coordinator and lecturer, his lessons used to be a bit boring, as we usually found it hard to hear he remained interested as he used the same tone throughout all his lectures. 

I helped the group by reminding them of deadlines, and of tasks they had to do. I also stayed on top of the ball and managed the tasks each member had to do and made sure they all corresponded and made sense with each other. 

WIL has greatly helped me understand how it would feel to pitch a new app or website had we have to make one in the future. How to deal with challenges and present ourselves to the right audience. It helped us with real scenarios we would have to deal with in the future if we proceed with the development of applications and websites.
