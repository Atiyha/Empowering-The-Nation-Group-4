SELF EVALUATION ESSAYS

Liam Marais

During WIL I learned how to use a brainstorming session, Time management and crisis management. In the beginning of the project our team had brainstorming sessions to try and make ideas for what the app and website would look like and how the user experience would be. We also had brainstorming sessions after we knew what were going to do to try and improve on what we already had. I also used time management to meet the deadlines that the team had set for us to be finished in time. I had to use crisis management to try and fix issues that we had with the website as well as try to fix code that may have had errors. 
My role in the team was to be the head coder for the website although Dezlan and Atiyha helped a lot with the codding, content and visuals of the website. While making the website Dezlan and Atiyha always brought up good points about the website, I also did the same for the app and the presentations. 
To find more information about how we were going to make the website I decided to look at some of the other colleges websites to get an idea of what the website would look like. I used the internet to brows through some of the websites that colleges have and made a skeleton of what was in some of the websites.
I believe I exceled in my time management as I always met the deadlines that we set for ourselves I think that was my main strong point. My main weak point was presenting I donâ€™t like giving presentations especially to groups of people. 
I enjoyed the way that the WIL instructor presented his lessons, he made everyone feel welcome and heard in his classes.
I helped the group be staying positive and by staying up to date with the deadlines the we made 
WIL was a great way to show how working in a group for the certain task could be in the real world work environment.
